# MVT-GameCreatorStuff
Stuff i use along with game creator, triggers, igniters, actions

FindGameObjectAction.CS =  Finds a gameobject and stores it in global var list,  Remmeber to define GC Gloval Var first.
IgniterMVTKeyDown.cs = Trigger on Unity Input rather than hardcoded keys, allowing keys to be changed from player interaction.
